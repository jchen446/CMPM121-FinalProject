### NPC Chase Scene: Bear Infested Forest

Particle System: We have a campfire next to the players starting scene which has a particle system on it.
	Along with that we are using a particle system when the bullet lands.

5 Meaningful imported assets: We have a bear asset which is essential to the scene and have some tree assets,
	some rock assests, some grass asset as well, and lastsly we have a bush and campfire assest that we are
	using to complete the scene and make the theme of the forest whole.

Controllable Character: We do in fact have a controllable main character that moves with player input and is
	in first person camera.

We are doing the NPC Chase Scene and we are using multiple bear NPC's to chase down the player on their own.
	
There are multiple interactions with the NPC's for example there is the bear that gets the player and causes 
	the game to end, also the player could kill the NPC bear and live which cause the bear to die.

There are also plenty of obstacle such as trees, bushs, rocks, and event the terrain itself because we made a
	mountain that the player would have to climb to get around.

We used a directional light in our scene as the sun and we have it to make the scene darker and more of a
	scary bear chase scene. Also we have textured/materialized everything and added a new skybox to help
	convey the outdoor scene.
